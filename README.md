### 1. Assessing Verisk Accuracy for Insurance Verification

This project evaluates Veriskâ€™s insurance verification accuracy by comparing database records with XML responses. I mimicked the validation rules used by the actual third-party provider, Verisk, using Python and conducted detailed analyses to extract trends and identify recurring patterns in verification outcomes. This approach provided actionable insights into the service's effectiveness.

**Key Technologies**: SQL, Python, XML parsing, matplotlib  

**Highlights**:
- Implemented Python-based rules to replicate Verisk's verification process and ensure policy compliance.
- Extracted and analyzed trends in full, partial, and non-verifications over specific time periods.
- Identified recurring insurance providers and their correlation with verification outcomes.
- Ensured robust handling of XML data to accurately validate rules against business requirements.

**Visualization**:
