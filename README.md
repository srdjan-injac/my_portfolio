## Welcome to my portfolio

This portfolio highlights my skills as a data analyst and features four key projects, each with its own dedicated page for detailed descriptions, visualizations, and insights.Additionally it includes a collection of course projects and personal projects that demonstrate my continued learning and exploration of data analysis concepts.

## Key Projects

### 1. [Assessing Verisk Accuracy for Insurance Verification](https://srdjan-injac.github.io/Verisk-Accuracy/)

This project evaluates Verisk’s insurance verification accuracy by comparing database records with XML responses. I mimicked the validation rules used by the actual third-party provider, Verisk, using Python and conducted detailed analyses to extract trends and identify recurring patterns in verification outcomes. This approach provided actionable insights into the service's effectiveness.

**Key Technologies**: SQL, Python, XML parsing

**Highlights**:
- Implemented Python-based rules to replicate Verisk's verification process and ensure policy compliance.
- Extracted and analyzed trends in full, partial, and non-verifications over specific time periods.
- Identified recurring insurance providers and their correlation with verification outcomes.
- Ensured robust handling of XML data to accurately validate rules against business requirements.

### 2. [Document Response and Classification Analysis](https://srdjan-injac.github.io/doc_classification_stats/)

This project focused on analyzing user responses and document classification accuracy on Vroom website. Users uploaded various documents, which were classified using OCR. Incorrect documents triggered error messages, prompting users to take action. The goal was to generate weekly and monthly statistics on user responses and evaluate the accuracy of the document classification system.

**Key Technologies**: Python, SQL, OCR

**Highlights**:
- Generated **weekly and monthly statistics** on user behavior and response patterns:
  - Re-uploading corrected documents.
  - Retrying with the same document.
  - No response to error messages.
- Evaluated document classification accuracy to support **continuous improvement**.
- Identified trends in user response rates, **highlighting areas for optimization**.

### 3. [Analyzing Carlton’s Tax and Fee Calculations](https://srdjan-injac.github.io/carlton_tax_accuracy/)

This project assessed the accuracy of Carlton’s tax and fee estimations by comparing them against itemized DMV data extracted using OCR from document scans. The analysis was requested by the business to evaluate whether Carlton’s tax estimation services are accurate and reliable enough to be utilized for calculating taxes and fees for dealers and applicants.

**Key Technologies**: Python, SQL, OCR, XML Parsing

**Highlights**:
- Extracted DMV-reported tax and fee values from scanned documents using OCR and compared them to Carlton's estimates.
- **Identified average, maximum, and minimum discrepancies** in both tax and fee datasets.
- Visualized discrepancies with box plots and histograms to uncover outliers and trends.
- **Highlighted potential mismatches** in reporting and calculation methods between the datasets.

### 4. [Evaluating Insurance Policy Continuity with Verisk](https://srdjan-injac.github.io/active_insurance_policies/)

This project assessed the utility of Verisk's insurance data in verifying applicant insurance policies and predicting future policy continuity. The analysis focused on determining the continuity and cancellation history of insurance policies by examining transaction records, renewal patterns, and VIN matches and evaluated the relationship between prior active policies and future policy behavior. The findings highlighted the predictive value of historical policy continuity for risk mitigation.

**Key Technologies**: Python, SQL, JSON Parsing

**Highlights**:
- **Analyzed historical insurance policies** for VIN matches and cancellation patterns.
- Identified continuous insurance policies with no cancellation history.
- Categorized policies based on policy activity and VIN matches for actionable insights.
- Demonstrated that applicants with prior active policies were significantly **more likely to maintain future insurance coverage**.
